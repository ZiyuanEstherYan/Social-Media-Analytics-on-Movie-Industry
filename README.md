## Summary of Project
The purpose of this project is to rank bank complaints so that the cases that need monetary compensation can be dealt with first. Exploratory analysis was first performed to determine what factors to include in the predictive model. Three deep learning models were trained to compare the result and the best model was used for the binary prediction. Cases were sorted in descending order of the predicted probabilities.
